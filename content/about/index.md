Hi! My name is Flavio. I am a statistician, currently working in the Machine Learning Research group at Bayer Pharmaceuticals. I develop new deep learning methods to enhance morphological profiling in the context of high-content imaging. Previously, I did an internship in machine learning with the same group, where I worked on analyzing knowledge graphs with GNNs to identify new trends. I also was working student at [fu:stat](http://www.stat.fu-berlin.de/en) – the statistical consulting unit of the Free University of Berlin. I loved the challenge of tackling very different cases each week.

I did my Master's at the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de). I am fascinated by the intersection between statistics, programming, and business. I focused on machine learning, causality and Bayesian statistics. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Economics and another one in Comparative Literature and Computer Science from the [Free University of Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de). I enjoy being an active part of the tech community and attending Meetups and conferences. Currently, I am a co-organizer of the [Berlin Bayesians Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BerlinBayesians/).

Outside of academia, I have worked in business consulting – both as a freelancer and as an intern. I have lead and been part of projects in market research, process management, and organizational restructuring.
