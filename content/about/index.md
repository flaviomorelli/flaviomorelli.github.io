Hi! My name is Flavio. I am a statistician, currently enrolled as a Master's student at the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de). I am fascinated by the intersection between statistics, programming, and business. I focus on machine learning and Bayesian statistics.  I also have a Bachelor's degree in Economics and another one in Comparative Literature and Computer Science from the [Free University of Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de). 

At the moment, I am doing an internship in machine learning at Bayer in Berlin, where I am working on analyzing knowledge graphs with GNNs to identify new trends. Previously, I was working student at [fu:stat](http://www.stat.fu-berlin.de/en) – the statistical consulting unit of the Free University of Berlin. I loved the challenge of tackling very different cases each week. Besides, I have developed courses on statistical learning with Python and on data visualization with R for our training program. I also like being an active part of the tech community and attending Meetups and conferences. Currently, I am a co-organizer of the [Berlin Bayesians Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BerlinBayesians/). I enjoy sharing knowledge and have volunteered to teach Python. 

Outside of academia, I have worked in business consulting – both as a freelancer and as an intern. I have lead and been part of projects in market research, process management, and organizational restructuring.
