Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Flavio, and I have a strong passion for developing machine learning methods to enhance the drug discovery process. My experience spans projects focused on disease understanding, multi-omics integration, target discovery, and toxicity prediction. I leverage techniques from various fields, including deep learning, computer vision, Bayesian statistics, and causality. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Scientist at Bayer Pharmaceuticals.

I am finishing my PhD in bioinformatics under the supervision of [Katharina Baum](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VRDJXPQAAAAJ&hl=de).  I earned my Master's degree in statistics from the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de), and my Bachelor's degree in economics at the [Freie University of Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en). I enjoy being an active part of the tech community, regularly attending Meetups and conferences. Currently, I co-organize [Berlin Bayesians Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BerlinBayesians/).

I am fascinated by the intersection between machine learning, engineering, and business. Prior to my role as a Machine Learning Scientist, I gained experience in business consulting, both as a freelancer and an intern, where I led and contributed to projects in market research, process management, and organizational restructuring.
