I offer consulting services to (PhD-)students and scientific institutions with regards to statistical and programming questions. 
In the last years, I have done over 30 consulting projects ranging from Bachelor's theses to PhD theses and publications in a wide variety of disciplines such as medicine, biology, political theory and computer science. Trainings on topics such as basic statistics, machine learning, and programming (R, Python, Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch) are available on request.
