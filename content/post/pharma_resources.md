A year ago, I got an opportunity to do an internship at a large pharmaceutical company.
My background is on machine learning and economics, so I was thrown into cold water.
I had a hard time understanding what my colleagues were working on, and also figuring out how this sector works.
Over the last year, I have found a few useful resources that might be helpful to others in a similar situation.
This list will focus on podcasts and books.

# Podcasts

## Talking Biotech – Dr. Kevin Folta

To me this is one of the best podcasts on biotech out there.

## The Top Line – Fierce Pharma

## Business of Biotech

## Biotech 2050

## Nature Podcast

The scope of this [podcast](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=nature-podcast) is broader than just pharma or biotech.
It usually summarizes the main findings in the _Nature_ journal.
Besides articles about cancer tumors, you will also find articles on broader topics such as the ethics of transplanting human neurons into animals or open-science initiative to tackle vaccine inequity.

## Biotech Bros

First of all, you should _not_ take this [podcast](https://www.biotechbros.com/) as investment advice!
To my taste, the host of this podcast sounds at times overconfident and there he has a tendency to ramble and repeat himself.
Nevertheless, I have learned a few things from this podcast, especially regarding failed clinical trials and less well-known biotech companies.
Moreover, this podcast will give you a feeling of the most relevant business aspects in biotech and pharma.

## Pharmaceutical Executive Podcast

As the name suggests, this [podcast](https://www.pharmexec.com/podcasts) is geared towards executives, which means very short and condensed podcasts, verging on the superficial.
This podcast will not teach you much, but it is useful listen to it every now and then to get a sense of what the main concerns and the overarching trends of the sector.

# Books

Podcasts are by nature limited to a certain topic.
Sooner or later you will need to take a look at some books to get a better undertanding of the more general aspects.

## The Drug Discovery and Development Cycle: A concise overview of the key steps from concept to launch – Kabir Hussain

The title of this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55043547-the-drug-discovery-and-development-cycle?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=HkHDHzXdSE&rank=1) summarizes quite well what you can expect from it.
If you are new to drug discovery and development, this book will walk you through the whole process from target identification to manufacturing.
It focuses mainly on small molecules, but there is an interesting chapter of biologics.
The book is very concise and you can read it in an afternoon.
This barebones approach also guarantees that this book will not become outdated so fast.

## Mark Lynas – Seeds of Science

## OpenStaxx books

If your academic background is not in natural sciences, OpenStaxx provides high-quality and up-to-date handbooks on a wide array of topics such as [biology](https://openstax.org/details/books/concepts-biology), [anatomy](https://openstax.org/details/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e), [chemistry](https://openstax.org/details/books/chemistry-2e) or [physics](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics-2e) to get you up to speed.
The best part: it's all free and available in multiple formats (online, pdf, Kindle, ...).
